# # Data and Variables

# ### 1. Understanding Types of Data

# 1. Numerical Continuous Data :
#       -Data that has a continuous range.
#       -Regression problems take care of such a data
#       -it can further be divided into :
#       
#        a) Ratio:
#            -Data having sense of 0.0 or float values
#            -Example: height, weight, length..
#            
#        b) Interval:
#            -Date present in specific range
#            -Example: 10,000 to 20,000 with a gap of  5,000 each
#                    : 10,000;15000;20000;...
# 
# 2. Numerical Discrete or Categorial Data:
#       -This can further be divided into:
#        
#        a) Nominal Data: 
#            -The data which has no relation between each other.
#            -Example: colour of hair, gender.
#            
#        b) Ordinal Data:
#            -When the data has some sense of order in it.
#            -Example:poor,average, better ; low, medium, high
#            
#        c) Dichotomous Daya:
#            -The data is divided into just two categories i.e binary categorial data
#            -Example: true,false; yes,no;  
#            
# 3. Raw Data:
#         - The data that is unstructured is called as raw data.
#         - It may have eroors, can be of many forms and can be non validated.
#         - Example: !!!@RT-this data is not in numerical form that is req. by machine. It has !!!, @ non meaningful symbols.
# 
# 4. Time Series:
#         - Sequence of data points are successively spaced at uniform intervals
#         - Example: data in video format or time dependant data
#         
# 5. Structured Data:
#         - Data is present in a tabulated form. Data that you can read from a database
#         - Example: .xls(excel files)
# 
# 6. Unstructured Data:
#         - Data having no structure or data that has to be converted to some numerical tabular form.
#         - Example: audio files, images, text documents, pdf files..
# 
# 7. Semi-Structured Data:
#         - Data havig some kind of structure but not completely in numerical form i.e. data is semi processed
#         - Example: .csv (comma seperated values), .json files                 

# ### 2. Variables

# Variables can be divided into two parts: Dependant Variables and Independant Variables
# 
# 1. Dependant Variables:
#         - Variables that depends of some features, array, matrix,vectors...
#         - Also goes by names like labels, y, target values, output
#         - Example: Sum of all the marks in all the subjects for a student.
# 
# 2. Independant Variables: 
#         - Variables that defines the target values
#         - Also called as x, features...
#         - Often present in form of a table
#         - Example: Marks in all the subjects of a student
